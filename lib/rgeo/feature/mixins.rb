    # MixinCollection is a mechanism for adding arbitrary methods to
    # geometry objects.
    #
    # Normally, geometry objects respond to the methods defined in the
    # feature interface for that type of geometry; e.g.
    # RGeo::Feature::Geometry, RGeo::Feature::Point, etc. Some
    # implementations include additional methods specific to the
    # implementation. However, occasionally it is desirable also to
    # include custom methods allowing objects to function in different
    # contexts. To do so, provide those methods in a mixin Module, and
    # add it to an appropriate MixinCollection. A MixinCollection is
    # simply a collection of mixin Modules, connected to geometry types,
    # that are included in objects of that type.
    #
    # There is a global collection, MixinCollection::GLOBAL, which
    # manages mixins to be added to all implementations. In addition,
    # individual implementation factories may provide additional local
    # MixinCollection objects for mixins specific to objects created
    # by that factory.
    #
    # Each mixin module added to a MixinCollection is connected to a
    # specific type, which controls to which objects that mixin is added.
    # For example, a mixin connected to Point is added only to Point
    # objects. A mixin connected to GeometryCollection is added to
    # GeometryCollection objects as well as MultiPoint, MultiLineString,
    # and MultiPolygon, since those are subtypes of GeometryCollection.
    # To add a mixin to all objects, connect it to the Geometry base type.
