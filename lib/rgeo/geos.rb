module RGeo
  # The Geos module provides general tools for creating and manipulating
  # a GEOS-backed implementation of the SFS. This is a full implementation
  # of the SFS using a Cartesian coordinate system. It uses the GEOS C++
  # library to perform most operations, and hence is available only if
  # GEOS version 3.2 or later is installed and accessible when the rgeo
  # gem is installed. RGeo feature calls are translated into appropriate
  # GEOS calls and directed to the library's C api. RGeo also corrects a
  # few cases of missing or non-standard behavior in GEOS.
  #
  # This module also provides a namespace for the implementation classes
  # themselves; however, those classes are meant to be opaque and are
  # therefore not documented.
  #
  # To use the Geos implementation, first obtain a factory using the
  # ::RGeo::Geos.factory method. You may then call any of the standard
  # factory methods on the resulting object.
